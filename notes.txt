## HTTP/3  #[http3_summary] [[{protocol.http/3,performance.http/3]]
@[https://www.infoq.com/news/2020/01/http-3-status/]
* HTTP/2 introduced the concept of first-class streams embedded
  in the same TCP connection enabling multiplexing simultaneous
  request-response exchanges.
* HTTP/2 major flaw: when packet loss increases, performance
  degrades due to dependency on TCP packet retransmission
  (HOL blocking):
    When packet loss surpasses a given threshold it's slower than
    HTTP/1 multiple parallel TCP connections.
* QUIC (HTTP/3 or HTTP over UPD) has first-class streams. solving
  HTTP/2 issues.
