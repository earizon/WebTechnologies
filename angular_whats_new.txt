## Angular What's new

### Angular 13
* <https://www.infoq.com/news/2021/11/introducing-angular-13/>

### Angular v12 
* Transitions to Ivy Rendering Engine
* <https://www.infoq.com/news/2021/05/angular-12-ivy-default/>
* ...The Protractor end-to-end test framework will no longer be
  included in new projects. The team reports working with alternative
  popular solutions (e.g., Cypress, WebdriverIO, TestCafe)...

###  Angular 11
* <https://www.infoq.com/news/2020/11/angular-11/>
* <https://blog.angular.io/version-11-of-angular-now-available-74721b7952f7>
* Hot Module Replacement implementation:
  ```
  $ ng serve --hmr   ← It can be initialized with --hmr flag.
                       NG app will not need full page refresh on code changes:
                       Instead, latest changes to code/style/templates will be
                       updated directly while preserving the current state of
                       the application.
  ```

* Build process speed boost by upgrading to TypeScript 4.0
  and through improving the ngcc update process.

* developers can now opt-in to the experimental Webpack 5 support
  (faster builds with persistent disk caching and smaller bundle sizes
   using improved tree-shaking).  To enable it:
   "resolutions": { "webpack": "5.4.0" }  ← Add to package.json

* NG language service (popular add-on offers autocomplete, type checking, etc...)
  is being transitioned to the new Ivy engine, offering improved support for
  generic types.

* For simple upgrade of projects:
  ```
  $ ng update @angular/cli @angular/core
  ```
  WARN : for more complex updates, use the interactive update guide
         provided by the Angular team.

##  Angular 9
* <https://www.infoq.com/news/2020/02/angular-9-ivy-rendering-engine/>
* Ivy Compiler:
  Smaller bundle sizes, improved build times, and better debugging
  thanks to the release of the much anticipated Ivy rendering engine
  that has been in development by Google since 2018.
   Ivy uses tree shaking, allowing it to include only the parts of
  Angular needed for the current application.

##  Angular 5
 Service worker implementation shipping by default.
