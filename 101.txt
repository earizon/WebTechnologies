...  (2017) Big data: According to IBM5, 2.5 trillion6 data bytes are 
generated every day, and 90% of the global data was created during 
the past 2 years. These data come from sensors, messages posted on 
social networks, pictures and videos published on the Internet, from 
geolocation (for example, GPS or NFC) from mobile devices 
(smartphones, tablets, smart watches), traceability logs for online 
payments (for example from e-payments or m-payments), keywords 
entered in search engines and, more generally, any digital 
information that can be used for interpretation (scientific data, 
fraud detection, medical, personal, behavioral data, etc.). Big data 
can be defined by “3V”: volume (“data tsunami”: 20 petabytes7 of data 
are processed every day by Google, and this has been the case since 
2010, 1.88 zettabytes were produced in 2011, meaning a 50% increase 
per year), variety (web data from social networks, linked data from 
semantic web, public data, open data and mobiquitous data coming from 
tagged objects and sensor networks, etc.) and velocity (data flow 
from sensors and social networks, real-time “on the fly”), to which 
we add a fourth “V”: variability (evolution), and a fifth “V”: 
valorization (improvement and enrichment).
